# VFramework
Android framework for games. Nice design. Development of a game as a proof of concept.

This game shall be a very simple RPG for cellphones.
However, to abuse with animations and enjoy with fast development (the main objective is the framework, remember).

Future ideas are to make this game some sort of "support" for table RPG, where players may set their locations and even proceed combat.
